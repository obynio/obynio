### I caught fire coding.

The spark I was missing ignited the instant I installed my first Linux as a kid. It was almost magic, being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, just by typing a few commands in a Linux TTY. I mean seriously, how could it not be great when its mascot is a penguin ?

Since then, I can't get enough. This passion carried me through my education. I sharpened my skills on infrastructure and eventually learned about SRE, which calls to all my passions; it incorporates software engineering and infrastructure, and I'm allowed to break it to improve the code (in a separate git branch, of course).

Even when I leave the office, I tend to continue writing code on my own. Most recently I have been working on a plugin for Anki to help me learn Japanese. I find it beautiful how code can help you overcome challenges in life. It's oddly satisfying. And there's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve and yet more to build. And for this, I am truly grateful.

Core focuses of interest currently includes SRE, DevOps, Load-Balancing, Linux, Python, Golang, Django, Docker, Kubernetes. I typically ask my family to point out which of these are Pokemons.
